# MagSafe Holder

> TLDR: I designed and 3D printed a MagSafe holder for my Apple Thunderbolt Display. You can download the files [here](./models/). Have fun!

## Motivation

You probably heard of it before or experience it every day since 2020: [Webcams aren't not really good](https://reincubate.com/support/how-to/why-are-webcams-bad/#putting-them-to-the-test), in fact they suck. Especially if your main webcam is on a [display which was manufactured nearly a decode ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Thunderbolt_Display#Technical_specifications). Trying various solutions like a cheap webcam and a not-so-cheap GoPro brought me always back to the FaceTime cam on my iPhone. Combined with the excellent [Camo](https://reincubate.com/camo/) app, the quality of the picture is just not comparable to any other solution. However I needed a way to mount the iPhone on top of the display, so I decided to design something in Fusion 360. The pictures below show the process of various prototypes I printed, and the final solution in action. Download the files [here](./models/), have fun using/remixing them!

- [Apple MagSafe Charger](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHXH3AM/A/magsafe-charger) - I used the MagSafe charger for my initial (very crude) measurements.
- [Accessory Design
Guidelines for Apple
Devices](https://developer.apple.com/accessories/Accessory-Design-Guidelines.pdf) - Thanks to @mikeseeh I then referred to the proper specs for measurements and also the layout of the magnets. ðŸ˜…
- [Thunderbolt Display Headphone Hook](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:453561) - Measuring the curve on the back of the display was too much of a hurdle, so I dug through Thingiverse until I found some nice model which included the curve already. This headphone hook was perfect! Thanks a lot Joe Delong!
- [Small Neodymium Magnets](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B082R64C9N)
- [Field Paper](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B003N1LZXO) - Helped also a lot figuring out the layout of the magnets. Guess I'm the next mkbhd! ðŸ˜‚
- Anycubic i3 Mega S
- Cura and then PrusaSlicer - Just switched to PrusaSlicer as it now has official support for my printer, and the results are awesome!
- Some cheap PLA from AmazonBasics
- [Much better PLA from 3DJake](https://www.3djake.at/3djake/ecopla-schwarz)
- [Camo](https://reincubate.com/camo/) - Allows you to use your iPhone as a webcam, worth every cent!
- Some M2.5 screws. Using glue instead would have the same result I guess. Whatever.
